# poap-directory

This is the repo for <https://poap.directory>, a directory to browse and discover POAP projects, tools, and resources.



## Local Development

1. Clone the repo (or fork the repo to your account)
1. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
1. Create a feature branch off of the `dev` branch
1. Start the local server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
1. Go to <http://localhost:4400/> to view changes

To build the site use `bundle exec jekyll build`.

Resources:

- [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- [Liquid Syntax](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/)

Windows specific:
"bundle add webrick" might be required. Also: git config --global core.autocrlf false to prevent CRLF changes

The following changes might also be required for the Gemfile:
-------------------
#platforms :mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin, :jruby do
gem "tzinfo", "~> 1.2"
gem "tzinfo-data"
#end

#gem "wdm", "~> 0.1.1", :platforms => [:mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin]
gem 'wdm', '>= 0.1.0' if Gem.win_platform?
-------------------


### Conventions

- Use `POAP inc.`, not `POAP Inc.`
- Indents are 2 spaces (not tabs)
- 2 lines between frontmatter and content



## Adding a new integration

1. Go to `_data/integrations.yml` and add an entry using the following template:
    ```
    - id:
      title:
      img: /assets/img/integrations/
    ```

    key       | description
    ----------|------------
    id        | The product id; use the product title, lowercased, dashes instead of spaces
    title     | Product name
    img       | Logo of the product; place in `/assets/img/integrations/` (use an SVG if possible)

1. Create a new integration page under the `/integrations/` folder. For example, if adding Google Drive as an integration, create a `/resources/google-drive.md` file.
1. Within the file, add the following contents:
    ```
    ---
    layout: resource
    title: [integration] Resources
    permalink: /en/resources/[integration]
    ---
    ```
1. Replace `[integration]` with the integration name. For a Google Drive integration, the result would be:
    ```
    ---
    layout: resource
    title: Google Drive Resources
    permalink: /en/resources/google-drive
    ---

    ```


### Adding an integration to a resource

In the `_data/resource.yml` file add the integrations to the `integrations:` parameter for the relevant resource entry. The integrations are comma-delimited and referenced using the integration `id` from the integration's entry in the `_data/integrations.yml` file.

Using the Google Drive example above, a resource's integration entry would look like the following:
```
integrations: google-drive
```




## Adding a resource

Go to `_data/resource.yml` and add an entry using the following template:

```
- id:
  link:
  title:
  official:
  new:

**Note:** Entries appear on the website in the order listed in this file. If it's a less important resource then add it further down the list. If it's more important then insert it higher up.

### Adding a resource category

1. To create a new category, update the list of options here (in the above table) and at the top of the `_data/resources.yml` file, inserted in alphabetical order. Keep the category naming as descriptive yet broadly applicable as possible.
1. Create a new category page under the `/resources/` folder. For example, if creating a category "sports", create a `/resources/sports.md` file.
1. Within the file, add the following contents:
    ```
    ---
    layout: resource
    title: [category] Resources
    permalink: /en/resources/[category]
    ---
    ```
1. Replace `[category]` with the category name. For a "sports" category, the result would be:
    ```
    ---
    layout: resource
    title: Sports Resources
    permalink: /en/resources/sports
    ---

    ```
